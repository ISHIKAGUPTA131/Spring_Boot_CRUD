# Spring_Boot_CRUD
Here I have created a project using Spring boot

Steps:
Create a spring boot backend api using spring initialiser

Then create the varies packages in the java class i.e.

Service
Controller
Entity, etc.. 

Compile each time to check with codes you are changing. 

Then test your api's

I have used CRUD functionality in this project
Get, put, post, delete
